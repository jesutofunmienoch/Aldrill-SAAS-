🚀 Just Launched: My New AI-Powered Note Assistant Web App! 📚💬

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been building a powerful and interactive web application using *Next.js, **Tailwind CSS, and **TypeScript* — and I’m excited to finally share it with you!

🔍 *What does it do?*
This app is built for *students* and *lifelong learners. You can upload or paste your **course notes, and the app intelligently **scans and understands* the content. But it doesn’t stop there:

🎙 You can *have real-time voice conversations* with the AI based on your uploaded notes.
🧠 You can *ask the AI to quiz you* on what you've uploaded — a perfect way to reinforce learning.
🤖 We’ve added an exciting feature where you can *choose your preferred AI engine*:
 • ChatGPT
 • Grok
 • DeepSeek
 • Gemini

💡 Whether you're debugging code, preparing for exams, or just curious — you’re covered.

🧠 Voice AI was powered by *Vapi API, and for chatbot integration, we used **OpenAI’s API* to deliver responsive, context-aware conversations.


Huge thanks to the open-source community and tools that made this possible. Feedback and collaboration ideas are welcome — feel free to try it and let me know what you think!
